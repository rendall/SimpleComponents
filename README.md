# SimpleComponents
Basic components using vanilla javascript without frills. No functional programming, no reactive programming, no inversion of control, no encapsulation. These are designed either to be used in very simple projects or to be the starting point for fancier components.

Roadmap:
SimpleForm
SimpleAccordion
etc?  Requests?
